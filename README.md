# inverter-design-using-cadence-virtuoso
This project is to experiment with the working of a CMOS inverter and understand the parameters involved with it. The design will utilise the models that are present using cadence virtuoso.

The whole process starts with analysis of NMOS and PMOS devices, specifically the 1.8v standard models available inside the pdk to determine a common working W/L ratio and also the gm, ron and similar values. After this we start with the design of a CMOS inverter that includes schematic, measurement of various parameters like delays, noise margin, risetime, falltime, etc. This part would also act as a case study on SPICE where we use it's programming capabilities to better our abilities in measurements of aforementioned parameters. Then we will engage in the design a layout for our inverter in virtuoso layout editor. Here, we will also explore the different layers available to the user and how we utilise them in a design and what it translates to in terms of a mask. Lastly, we compare the two netlists, that is the schematic and the layout one, which is popularly referred to as LVS.

this is my first project. im just experimenting with stuff!!

let's try something new
